# learning-casa

This repository documents my learning and practice using **CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications)**
for radio interferometric data inspection, calibration, and imaging.

The focus is on understanding workflows and concepts rather than sharing proprietary or observational data.

## Topics Covered
- Starting and configuring CASA
- Understanding Measurement Sets (MS)
- Inspecting visibility data with `listobs`
- Visualising data and calibration tables using `plotms`
- Running CASA Python scripts
- Basic imaging and image inspection
- CASA ↔ Linux command interaction

## Repository Structure
- `docs/` – Conceptual explanations of CASA workflows
- `scripts/` – Example CASA scripts using generic datasets
- `notebooks/` – Walkthroughs of standard reduction steps
- `environment/` – Reproducible CASA/Python environment
- `data/` – Placeholder only (no observational data included)

## Notes on Data
No real observational data, proprietary datasets, or internal project material
are included in this repository. Dataset names, paths, and parameters are
generic or simulated for learning purposes.

## Tools
- CASA 6.5.x
- Python
- Linux-based workflows
